# 🚀 AI Resume Analyzer & Skill Gap Finder

A modern, AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes, extracts relevant skills, identifies skill gaps for a selected career role, and provides actionable career recommendations — all through a **stunning, premium dark-mode interface** with glassmorphism, floating gradient orbs, and smooth animations.

Built with **Python (FastAPI)** on the backend and a **TailwindCSS + custom CSS** frontend, this project focuses on **real-world resume analysis logic**, not hype-driven AI buzzwords.

2. Selects a **target career role** from the dropdown
3. Backend processes the resume:
   - Extracts text using `pdfplumber`
   - Identifies skills with regex-based NLP
   - Compares skills against role requirements
   - Calculates match percentage
   - Generates recommendations & learning links
4. Frontend displays:
   - Animated match score, matched/missing skill counts
   - Matched vs. missing skills as colour-coded tags
   - Expert feedback & career rating
   - Next steps checklist
   - Learning path resources
