---

## 🔄 3. Step-by-Step Data Flow

### Step 1️⃣ Resume Upload
**User uploads PDF resume and selects target career role**

User selects from roles like: Backend, Frontend, Data Science, DevOps, etc.

```
POST /analyze
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Parameters:
- resume: [PDF FILE]
- role: "backend"
- include_resources: true
```

---

### Step 2️⃣ PDF Parsing
**`resume_parser.py`** extracts raw text from PDF pages using pdfplumber library

- Extract text from all PDF pages
- Clean text (remove extra spaces, normalize newlines)
- Return cleaned resume text in lowercase

```python
def extract_text_from_resume(file: FileStorage) -> Optional[str]:
    """Extract and clean text from uploaded PDF resume"""
    # Uses pdfplumber to parse PDF
    # Cleans and normalizes text
    # Returns cleaned text
```

---

### Step 3️⃣ Skill Extraction
**`skill_extractor.py`** identifies all technical skills from resume text

- Search for programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Find frameworks and tools (React, Django, Express, etc.)
- Identify databases and platforms (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, etc.)
- Assign skill proficiency levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)

**Extracted Skills Example:**
```
Languages: python, javascript, java
Frameworks: react, django, express
Databases: postgresql, mongodb
Tools: docker, git, aws
```

---

### Step 4️⃣ Gap Analysis
**`skill_gap.py`** compares user's skills with role requirements

- Load role-specific skill requirements
- Compare against extracted skills
- Identify missing skills
- Categorize by priority:
  - 🔴 **Critical** - Must-have skills
  - 🟠 **High** - Strongly recommended
  - 🟡 **Medium** - Nice to have

```python
# Example gap analysis result
missing_skills = {
    "critical": ["Docker", "Kubernetes"],
    "high": ["React", "TypeScript"],
    "medium": ["Jest", "GraphQL"]
}
skill_gap_percentage = 35
```

---

### Step 5️⃣ Generate Recommendations
**Create actionable recommendations and learning roadmap**

- Prioritize skills to learn (based on role requirements)
- Suggest learning resources (courses, tutorials, documentation)
- Provide career feedback and insights
- Include estimated timelines for skill acquisition

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "skill": "Docker",
      "priority": "critical",
      "reason": "Essential for backend development",
      "resources": [
        {
          "name": "Docker Official Documentation",
          "type": "docs",
          "url": "https://docs.docker.com"
        },
        {
          "name": "Docker & Kubernetes Complete Guide",
          "type": "course",
          "url": "https://udemy.com/..."
        }
      ],
      "estimated_hours": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 6️⃣ Display Results
**Frontend renders interactive dashboard with analysis results**

- Show matched skills with visual indicators
- Display skill gaps in priority order
- Visualize learning roadmap with timelines
- Provide downloadable resources and recommendations
